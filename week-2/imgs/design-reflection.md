###What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
1. Information gathering: What are your goals with this website? What is the purpose of making this? What content would your target audience be looking for?
2. Planning: Make your site map. This will be a list of all main topic areas of the site as well as sub-topics. Remember, these topics must be in line with the goals and purpose you've identified when gathering information! Here, put thought into how users will navigate through these topic areas: what is most important for them to see? Plan to make the most crucial parts highly visible.
3. Design: Keeping in mind your target audience, choose a color scheme, logo, images, etc.
4. Development: Build your code, starting with your home page. At this point, build a shell for any other pages. This is also where things like shopping carts and forms are made active.
5. Testing and Delivery: Make sure forms and links work, check compatibility on different web browsers and devices. Get feedback from peers. Upload website files to the server. Optimize for search engines using appropriate title, description, and keyword tags. This is the stage the website becomes viewable to the public.
6. Maintenance: Keep updating - maybe try some A/B testing to see which version of the website is most user-friendly?

###What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The purpose of my website is to introduce myself to potential employers. The site will feature my background, passions, interests, and work history. It will also include links to my social media websites and the blog I just created. The idea is to present myself in a professional way and give employers many resources to explore and learn about me.

###What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience is interested in whether or not I am a good fit, culturally and technically, for their company. My site will address everything about my personal background and work history to my technical abilities and current projects, giving a well-rounded picture of myself. The idea here is to keep it professional, but also let my personality shine through. My audience will be also able to navigate through my social media presence and GitHub to determine whether or not I am a productive and active contributor to the developer community.

###What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary, or desired, action would be to contact me. In order to get in touch with these potential employers, I will need them to contact me! The flow of actions to get them to contact me, however, would be to navigate through my personal and technical pages, read and learn about me, see my work, decide it is interesting enough, and to then contact me at the end.

###What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
The more complex and interactive a website is, the more thought and attention must be put into design and user experience. This experience is going to determine whether or not people come back to your website, which is vital for the health of your website. Because there are so many users on the web now and so many incredible interactive websites out there, the bar is simply set higher. Websites that are pleasant to use are the ones that stand out to users and make them return. Conversely, if a website is just plain difficult and frustrating to navigate, there's no way it'll survive. Users are also accessing websites on a variety of devices and browsers, so many more levels of the experience must be taken into consideration to make sure your website is always compatible with this different formats. The bottom line is that we must develop websites with the end user in mind in order to build something people actually want and will enjoy using.

###What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience design is how a user feels when interacting with your website. It is extremely valuable because a user will likely remember this feeling and use it when deciding whether or not to return to your page. If a user has a bad experience and associates this feeling with  your website, you'll get less visits, and in some cases, make less money if your website involves e-commerce! Questions to ask yourself when considering the UX are:
-Is it easy to use?
-Is it compatible with different web browsers, devices, and screen readers?
-How accessible is it to people of different abilities?
-How pleasant is the experience overall?

###Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Creating the site-map seemed a bit tedious to me because mine was SO bare-bones. I know it will build over time, but I basically created a map using the bullet points given for this challenge! This could be because I am not sure how these types of personal websites usually function as I've never built something like this for potential employers. I'm excited to build off of this bare skeleton.
