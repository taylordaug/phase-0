###What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a blueprint of your website. It is a rough sketch of what the website will look like to a user. It includes menus, buttons, where images will go, and the basic skeleton for how a user will navigate through. This is where you establish the information hierarchy, making it clear to users (even in a bare bones black and white skeleton version) which parts are most important and the order in which they should navigate through. Everything should be extremely clear in the wireframe - you should never rely on colors or images later on to clarify things.

###What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing helps you iterate on your design. You can keep experimenting until you settle on what you'd like your website to look like. You are not committing to anything in code form, you are just brainstorming and letting the ideas flow at this point. It is much better to try things out at this point instead of having to go into your code to change things later!

###Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
This was really fun for me! I love the design/creative aspect of coding and loved playing around with the features on MockFlow Wireframe Pro. I felt like a real website designer and it was exciting to plan out something that I will actually be building myself.

###Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I definitely didn't stick with my first idea. I browsed some templates, considered websites I liked and their attributes, and then just started playing around with features, placing them on my page to see how they looked. Considering that the purpose for my website is to attract potential employers, I wanted to make sure it was simple and clean. Instead of having a separate page for users to contact me, I realized that the methods for contacting me should always be visible. I landed on having the contact tools and icons for my social media pages in the footer so it will always be accessible. This is the action I want employers to take, so keeping it here makes it easier to access at any point while navigating through my page. I had to stop myself from continually revising because it was too fun playing with the tools!

###What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I mostly used MockFlow WireframePro to answer my wireframing questions. I wasn't sure how to create a wireframe myself, so I browsed the templates and basically just played around with the tools, pulled them up, and figured out what each represented. I needed help getting an idea of what a website of this nature should look like, and the templates helped me. Something that is still tripping me up is merging and syncing my git versions with the master branch - I used the atlassian.com git tutorial on syncing to make sure I had these git commands down and I was using the up-to-date version of my phase-0 repository. I had major issues inserting my inline image in the markdown file for challenge 2.3 because my relative path wasn't matching up - I'm assuming my local branch wasn't up-to-date with the remote version. Now I am not having that issue!

###Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
Again, I loved making my wireframe - my website is coming to life! I wasn't sure how far I should go with my wireframe, so had to stop myself so I didn't spend hours on it. I wouldn't describe this as tedious necessarily, because I liked adding details that made my wireframe start to look like a realistic website.
