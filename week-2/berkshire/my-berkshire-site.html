What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It felt great to use the tags and see them work on an actual html page in real time! I could test out tags, reload my page, and make sure things were showing up properly. I have to make sure I am always closing tags properly, especially when they are self-closing or require an attribute. The tags are pretty self-explanatory, so with some tweaks on where the closing tags actually went, it wasn't too difficult.

How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It is difficult to keep track of all the nested elements! My pair and I realized that trying to make a table with an unordered list required about 5 nested tags PER cell: table, tr, td, ul, li - which is crazy. We stopped trying to do this after one cell. Clearly, making tables this way is not a best practice, and we are looking forward to using div elements with CSS next week to see if there is a better way to create tables like these.

How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Since we both knew CSS is coming up next week, we didn't attempt to format any HTML. We did look up some characters like the copyright and trademark symbols, which had quick HTML conventions for us to add in. I did try to link the img src to the berkshire hathaway website, and my partner pointed out to me that the source should actually be the image file on my computer so that in case that website were to ever go down, the image would still be available since it's housed locally on my computer.

What seems good and bad about HTML?
The nested tags must get very complicated in more complicated websites. Tables with specific elements inside them get very complicated - it seems we can get around this with CSS divs.

What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Always close a tag right after you open it and then work inside them. Always close tags in order - what was most recently opened must be the first closed. For me, it will take seeing and reading these tags many times to commit them to memory. Some are easier to memorize because the tags are very close to the action they take - like img or table. Some tags stick out to me, like img, because it is a self closing tag, meaning it doesnt need a closing img tag at the end. I will keep a lookout for these unconventional tags and commit them to memory (or I can always look them up!).
