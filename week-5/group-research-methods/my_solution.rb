# Person 1's solution
  #input: array of strings, one letter
  #output: NEW array of strings
  #steps:
  #1. turn array into list of strings
  #split all words into their individual letters
  #2. iterate through all letters in words in array
  #3. IF word contains letters, add to new array or keep in current array
  #ELSE delete from array, or don't add to new array

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# keep_if: deletes every element of the array or hash that the code block evaluates to false
# include?: returns true if given object is present in array (if any element == object), otherwise return false
#.keys - returns new array of only the keys of the hash

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
