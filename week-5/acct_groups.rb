=begin
Input: Array of strings (names) separated by commas
Output: Array inside array with names
Steps:
1. Create new array that is array within an array and set the default length to 5
1. Find how many people are in array (length)
2. Divide that length so that 3 are left (modulus) and figure out how many groups it divides into
3. Create a new array with the number of spaces you find in #2
4. Add people from first array into new array
5. If the last array[..-1] array length is less than 3, split it up and add it to first array
